        <p> 
            The scope of this field is evolving as new technologies are developed and the need for security in all aspects of life increases.
            
            Vehicle pentesting has expanded significantly in scope over the last few years. The number of vehicles on the road has grown exponentially, as has the associated risk. This is why businesses are increasingly investing in vehicle pentesting services to ensure their fleets are protected against cyber attacks and other threats.
            
            The market for vehicle pentesting has exploded in recent years. There are now numerous companies (including HackersEra) that offer their clients vehicle pentesting services.
            
            As the scope of this field expands, so does the need for more professionals in it. Numerous new jobs are now available as a result of the growth of this niche industry.
